#summary Annotating With Statements/Graphs

Several users have been asking how it is possible to have as object of a _hasTopic_ property something more complex than a URI: a statement or collection of statements.

In order to explain what can be done with AO I am going to use an example: let's say in a document we have a line saying: *GeneG encodes ProteinP*. What we can do with AO is annotating the single item of the sentence and also encode the sentence itself as a triple (or set of triples).
