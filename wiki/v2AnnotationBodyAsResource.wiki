= Annotation Body As Resource Identified by a URI =

In alternative to [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal rdfs:Literal], the _ao:body_ can be modeled as a resolvable entity of its own identified by a URI. Such body can be better detailed with metadata such as properties specifying authors, character encoding and format. 

Here is a very simple example in n3 format:

{{{ 
 <http://www.example.org/annotation/10022> a ao:Annotation ;
    ao:annotatesResource <http://www.hcklab.org/images/people/paolo_ciccarese.jpg> ;
    ao:body <http://www.paolociccarese.info/> ;
    pav:createdBy <http://www.paolociccarese.info/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    pav:createdOn "2012-02-12T15:02:14Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
}}}

The interpretation of the above set of triples is simple: the URI linked by the _ao:body_ is somehow about the resource identified by the URI {{{http://www.hcklab.org/images/people/paolo_ciccarese.jpg}}}

*Notes*: 
 * the body content, as it is identified by a URI, can be targeted by other annotations.
 * it is not recommended for _ao:body_ to link a URI that identifies a RDF file unless such file is intended for human consumption only.

=== Note Body as a Document ===

Because of the body is identified by a URI, it can be targeted by other annotations. 

=== Annotation of Body Document ===

=== Annotation of Body Document Fragment ===

Similarly, it is possible to annotate a fragment of the annotation body through an appropriate text selector.
