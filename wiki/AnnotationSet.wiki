Annotation Set(s) are container of Annotation items. They are used to organize a collection of items and refer to them as a whole. This can be particularly useful for instance for defining access restriction rules on a set of Annotation items.

<b>Figure 1: example of Annotation Set with a single Annotation item.</b>

In figure 1, the set has a declared topic: "Protein". It would be possible to automatically verify that all the items in the set are actually proteins; in fact, GO:Protein is equivalent to PRO:000000001 protein. As the Annotation items have topics that can be checked against the PRO ontology.
