Annotation Set(s) are container of Annotation items. They are used to organize collection of items and refer to them as a whole. This can be particularly useful for defining access restriction rules on a set of Annotation items and/or for grouping Annotation items with similar topic. For instance, in figure 1 the declared topic is PRO:00000001 (Protein).

<b>Figure 1: example of Annotation Set with a single Annotation item.</b>

In figure 1, the set has a declared topic: "Protein". It would be possible to automatically verify that all the items in the set are actually proteins.
