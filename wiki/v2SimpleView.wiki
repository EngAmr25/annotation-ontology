#summary A Simple View of the Annotation Ontology

== Introduction ==

The idea of Annotation Ontology (AO) is very simple yet powerful, AO allows you to:
 * Annotate: 
   * *Resources* such as HTML, PDF, Word, Excel documents, images, videos, databases, web services, experiments metadata... *and their fragments*
 * With (or without) a: 
   * *Topic* expressed by free text, structured text, URIs, RDF entities, RDF graphs, terms from domain ontologies…
 * While Tracing:
   * *Provenance*: who created what, when, with which software, with what expectations…
