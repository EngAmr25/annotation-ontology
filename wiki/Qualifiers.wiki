=== Annotation Type: Qualifier ===

Using Qualifier(s) is equivalent in tagging a document where, instead of a free text tag, a specific entity - identified by a URI - has been used. 

<blockquote>
A <b>Qualifier</b> expresses a relationship between the object of the annotation and a well-defined semantic entity. It allows also a free text body. If only the latter is present this is equivalent to a classic tag.

<b>Figure 1 - Example of annotation of type Qualifier. The entire document is linked to the entity Beta-Secretase-1 from the PRotein Ontology (PRO). Defining a Qualifier means relating the annotated document - or part of it - and the semantic entity.</b>

=== Annotation Type: Exact Qualifier ===

<blockquote>
An <b>Exact Qualifier</b> is used when the object of the relationship ao:hasTopic is representing exactly the portion of the annotated document.

=== Annotation Type: Broader Qualifier ===

<blockquote>
A <b>Broader Qualifier</b> is used when the object of the relationship ao:hasTopic is representing broadly the portion of the annotated document.

<b>Figure 3 - Example of annotation of type BroaderQualifier. The entity 'Skull Fracture' is a more generic concept representing the portion of the image which is tagged as a 'Linear Skull Fracture' as can be read in the ann:body.</b>

=== Annotation Type: Narrower Qualifier ===

<blockquote>
A <b>Narrower Qualifier</b> is used when the object of the relationship ao:hasTopic is representing a more specific entity than the portion of the annotated document.
</blockquote>

=== Annotation Type: Close Qualifier ===

<blockquote>
A <b>Close Qualifier</b> is used when the object of the relationship ao:hasTopic is representing closely but not exactly the portion of the annotated document.
