=== Annotation Type: Qualifier ===

Using Qualifier(s) is equivalent in tagging a document where, instead of a free text tag, a specific entity - identified by a URI - has been used. 

<blockquote>
A <b>Qualifier</b> expresses a relationship between the object of the annotation and a well-defined semantic entity. It allows also a free text body. If only the latter is present this is equivalent to a classic tag.

=== Annotation Type: Exact Qualifier ===

<blockquote>
An <b>Exact Qualifier</b> is used when the object of the relationship ao:hasTopic is representing exactly the portion of the annotated document.
