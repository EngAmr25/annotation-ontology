=== Annotation Type: Qualifier ===

Using Qualifier(s) is equivalent in tagging a document where, instead of a free text tag, a specific entity - identified by a URI - has been used. 

A <b>Qualifier</b> expresses a relationship between the object of the annotation and a well-defined semantic entity. It allows also a free text body. If only the latter is present this is equivalent to a classic tag.
