In Annotea, annotations are typed. It is possible to subclass _Annotation_ into more specific annotation classes with their own properties. In AO we adopt a similar mechanism - it is possible to create annotation types by sub-classing or by composition - to cover *much more than simple tagging: comments, notes, examples, erratum, definition, hypothesis, claims, research questions...* all with respect to the existing ontologies.

== Type by sub-classing ==
Like it was happening in Annotea it is possible to create new types simply sub-classing the Annotation class.

=== Annotation Type: Note ===

A _Note_ is a body of text/html attached to a document or part of it. The class _Note_ is a subclass of the class _Annotation_.

[http://annotation-ontology.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/Image%20Annotation%20Note%20-%20AO%20Annotation%20Ontology%20-%20by%20Paolo%20Ciccarese.png]<br/>
<b>Figure 1 - Example of note in AO. As it was happening in Annotea, in AO we can subclass the Annotation class into a more specific annotation class. In this case we have a Note regarding a portion of an image. The latter is specified through an _Image Selector_.</b>

The RDF of the example in picture 1 would look like the following:
{{{
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://my.example.org/ann/82400">
        <rdf:type rdf:resource="Note"/>
        <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#Annotation"/>
        <ann:annotates rdf:resource="http://tinyurl.com/35a6fnq"/>
        <ann:context rdf:resource="http://my.example.org/sel/20300"/>
        <ann:body>This visual cluster is probably representing the Foo Community</ann:body>
        <pav:createdOn>2010-03-21</pav:createdOn>
        <pav:createdBy rdf:resource="http://www.hcklab.org/foaf.rdf#me"/>
    </rdf:Description>
}}}

and the image selector:

{{{
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://my.example.org/sel/20300">
        <rdf:type rdf:resource="ImageSelector"/>
        ...
    </rdf:Description>
}}}

As you might notice, the annotation instance is declared of both type _Note_ and _Annotation_, this is common in RDF to allow querying without the need of inference.

=== Annotation Type: Erratum ===

[http://annotation-ontology.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/Text%20Annotation%20Erratum%20-%20AO%20Annotation%20Ontology%20-%20by%20Paolo%20Ciccarese.png]<br/>
<b>Figure 2 - Example of erratum in AO. The text 'BACE' should be replaced by 'BACE1'. The content of the 'ann:body' can be also HTML.</b>

The RDF of the erratum example:
{{{
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://my.example.org/ann/82400">
        <rdf:type rdf:resource="Erratum"/>
        <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#Annotation"/>
        <ann:annotates rdf:resource="http://tinyurl.com/35a6fnq"/>
        <ann:context rdf:resource="http://my.example.org/sel/20300"/>
        <ann:body>BACE1</ann:body>
        <pav:createdOn>2010-03-21</pav:createdOn>
        <pav:createdBy rdf:resource="http://www.hcklab.org/foaf.rdf#me"/>
    </rdf:Description>
}}}

It would be possible also to develop different types of errata to cover all the possible cases.

== Type by composition ==
Instead of subclassing the _Annotation_ class as it was happening in Annotea, it is also possible to define an instance of the annotation inheriting from multiple classes.

=== Annotation Type: Qualifier ===

Using Qualifier(s) is equivalent in tagging a document where, instead of a free text tag, a specific entity - identified by a URI - has been used.

<b>Figure 1 - Example of annotation of type Qualifier. The annotation is performed on a section of an image.</b>

The RDF of the example in picture 3 would look like the following:
{{{
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://my.example.org/ann/82400">
        <rdf:type rdf:resource="Qualifier"/>
        <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#Annotation"/>
        <ann:annotates rdf:resource="http://tinyurl.com/35a6fnq"/>
        <ann:context rdf:resource="http://my.example.org/sel/20300"/>
        <ao:hasTopic rdf:resource="http://my.example.org/sn/000004015"/>
        <pav:createdOn>2010-03-21</pav:createdOn>
        <pav:createdBy rdf:resource="http://www.hcklab.org/foaf.rdf#me"/>
    </rdf:Description>
}}}

the image selector:

{{{
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://my.example.org/sn/000004015">
        <rdf:type rdf:resource="ImageSelector"/>
        ...
    </rdf:Description>
}}}
