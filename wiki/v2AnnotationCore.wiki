#summary Annotation Core.


=== Core of the Annotation ===

The annotation core has been strongly inspired by the model proposed by the [http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/ Annotea Project]. In both cases, annotations live outside the annotated resource. In particular, the following entities/properties have been extended/reused:

 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#Annotation ao:Annotation (class)]: A super class describing the common features of annotations. The AO class Annotation is sub-classing the Annotea Annotation class and imposing AO related constraints.
 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#annotates ao:annotates]: The relation between an annotation resource and the resource to which the annotation applies. In AO we introduced a sub-property, named _ao:annotates_ as well, where the domain is the class _ao:Annotation_.
 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#context ao:context]: Context within the resource named in annotates to which the annotation most directly applies. In AO we introduced a sub-property, named _ao:context_ as well, where the domain and range are restricted to AO classes _ao:Annotation_ and _ao:Selector_. Read more about the [v2Selectors ao:Selector here].
 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#body ao:body]: The content of the annotation. It can be text - including hypertext - or a resource identified by a URI - an HTML document. Read more about the [v2AnnotationBody use of _ao:body_ here].

In Annotea, annotations are typed. It is possible to subclass _Annotation_ into more specific annotation classes with their own In AO we adopt a similar mechanism to cover *highlights, tagging, comments, notes, examples, errata...* see [v2AnnotationTypes AO Annotation Types]
