=== Structured annotation on single target resources ===

While creating notes with free text is common practice, creating annotation pointing to URIs can be more powerful and easier to understand by machines. In Annotation Ontology (AO) we can create annotation pointing to URIs through the relationship _ao:hasTopic_.

_Figure 1: in this example the Wikipedia link to the town of Ogunquit, Maine is attached to an image as annotation._

With AO we can attach topics expressed through URIs, for instance, to documents as in the following example where a term from the [http://pir.georgetown.edu/pro/ PRotein Ontology (PRO)] is linked to a document.
