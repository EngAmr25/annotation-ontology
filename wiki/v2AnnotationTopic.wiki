== ao:hasTopic ==

|| _*ao:hasTopic*_ || The _ao:hasTopic_ property refers to a URI that identifies the he subject matter of the targeted resource. ||

*Note:*
Every annotation is a point of view. Different agents can specify different subject matters while referring to the same resource. Some subject matters can be semantically compatible, some others might be not. This is a desired behavior as long as it is accompanied with proper provenance information. 

=== Annotation topics for human consumption ===

The simplest example consists in linking a resource for *human consumption*:

{{{ 
 # Example 1

 <http://www.example.org/annotation/10023> a ao:Annotation ;
    ao:annotatesResource <http://www.hcklab.org/images/people/paolo_ciccarese.jpg> ;
    ao:hasTopic <http://www.paolociccarese.info/>  ;
    pav:createdBy <http://www.paolociccarese.info/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    pav:createdOn "2012-02-12T15:02:14Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
}}}

The interpretation of the above statements is that the targeted image has the URI {{{http://www.paolociccarese.info/}}} - which would be possible to infer being a foaf:Person - as its topic. As you can easily verify, the URI {{{http://www.paolociccarese.info/}}} points to an HTML document, which has been created for human consumption.

=== Annotation topics for machine consumption ===

If the goal consists in linking a resource for *machine consumption* the above code would become something like:

{{{ 
 # Example 2

 <http://www.example.org/annotation/10023> a ao:Qualifier ;
    ao:annotatesResource <http://www.hcklab.org/images/people/paolo_ciccarese.jpg> ;
    ao:hasTopic <http://www.paolociccarese.info/foaf.rdf#me>  ;
    pav:createdBy <http://www.paolociccarese.info/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    pav:createdOn "2012-02-12T15:02:14Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
}}}

By changing the type of the annotation from _ao:Annotation_ to _ao:Qualifier_ the above set of statements is stating that the linked image has a topic identified by {{{http://www.paolociccarese.info/foaf.rdf#me}}} and that can be interpreted by a machine - typically a RDF resource. When the machine reads the URI, it can potentially retrieve additional statements about it (see [http://linkeddata.org/ Linked Open Data]).

*Note:*
The above set of statements (Example 2) could be expressed in a less concise way with the construct _ao:GraphAnnotation_ and _ao:body_ and a graph such as:

{{{
 # Alternative to Example 2 (using ao:GraphAnnotation and ao:body)

 {
 <http://www.example.org/annotation/10023> a ao:GraphAnnotation ;
    ao:annotatesResource <http://www.hcklab.org/images/people/paolo_ciccarese.jpg> ;
    ao:body :graphExample  ;
    pav:createdBy <http://www.paolociccarese.info/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    pav:createdOn "2012-02-12T15:02:14Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
 }

 :graphExample {
    <http://www.hcklab.org/images/people/paolo_ciccarese.jpg> a foaf:Image .

    <http://www.hcklab.org/images/people/paolo_ciccarese.jpg> foaf:depicts 
        <http://www.paolociccarese.info/foaf.rdf#me> .

    <http://www.paolociccarese.info/foaf.rdf#me> a foaf:Person ;
        foaf:name "Paolo Ciccarese" ;
        foaf:homepage "http://www.paolociccarese.info/" .
 }
}}}

This approach is more powerful and flexible but less concise and usually more complicated for applications to take care of. The construct _ao:Qualifier_ and _ao:hasTopic_ can be considered a short-cut.

*Note:*
Changing the annotation type of Example 2 back to _ao:Annotation_ will have the result of referring to an RDF file that has to be intended for human consumption: 

{{{ 
 <http://www.example.org/annotation/10023> a ao:Annotation ;
    ao:annotatesResource <http://www.hcklab.org/images/people/paolo_ciccarese.jpg> ;
    ao:hasTopic <http://www.paolociccarese.info/foaf.rdf#me>  ;
    pav:createdBy <http://www.paolociccarese.info/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    pav:createdOn "2012-02-12T15:02:14Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
}}}

Using the _ao:Annotation_ with _ao:hasTopic_ is equivalent to define a topic in a less formal way as the interpretation of the annotation is left to the human agent.
