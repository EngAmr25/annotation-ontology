With AO (Annotation Ontology) we would like to:

 * Annotate any document on the web (text, images, audio, video) and it’s parts. Unfortunately, if documents are easily identified by a URI, document parts or fragment are harder to identify. We would like to create a uniform mechanism to refer to all kinds of document parts.
 * Perform different kind of annotations: notes, semantic tags, errata, examples, hypothesis…
 * Persist the annotation separately from the document
 * Allow creation of manual annotation and integration of text mining results
 * Allow multiple annotation perspectives on the document at the same time
 * Allow curation of manual annotation - by curators or by an online community
 * Allow curation of automatic annotation and provide feedback to the service provider
 * Allow organizing the annotation in sets
