With AO (Annotation Ontology) we would like to:

 * Annotate any document on the web (text, images, audio, video) and it’s parts
 * Perform different kind of annotations: notes, semantic tags, errata, examples, hypothesis…
 * Persist the annotation separately from the document
 * Allow creation of manual annotation and integration of text mining results
 * Allow multiple annotation perspectives on the document at the same time
