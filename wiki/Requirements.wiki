With AO (Annotation Ontology) we would like to:

 * *Annotate any document on the web (text, images, audio, video) and it’s parts*. Unfortunately, if documents are easily identified by a URI, document parts or fragments are harder to identify. We would like to create a uniform mechanism to refer to all possible kinds of document parts.
 * *Perform different kinds of annotation*. Tags are only an example of annotation, others are: notes, semantic tags, errata, examples, hypothesis… We want to do this without inventing new domain ontologies, therefore we want to be able to reuse entities such as claim and hypothesis from the SWAN Ontology.
 * Persist the annotation separately from the document
 * Allow creation of manual annotation and integration of text mining results
 * Allow multiple annotation perspectives on the document at the same time
 * Allow curation of manual annotation - by curators or by an online community
 * Allow curation of automatic annotation and provide feedback to the service provider
 * Allow organizing the annotation in sets
