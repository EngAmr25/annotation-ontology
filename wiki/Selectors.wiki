#summary Selectors and their usage (updated: May 10th, 2010)

== AO: Selectors ==

A Selector identifies a portion of a resource, and may work differently for different types of documents and content types. Also for a specific content type, multiple kind of selector can be defined to cover specific needs.

== Classes Of Selectors ==

*Selector* is a generic class that can be customized for the different kind of content types:
 * Text Selector
 * Image Selector
 * Audio Selector 
 * ...

== Define New Selectors ==

We are not assuming we are able to provide every possible way to select any part of a any kind of document. Therefore, if the selector you have in mind is not yet existing, it is sufficient to define a new one sub-classing one of the existing Selector classes.
