== AO: Selectors ==

A *Selector* identifies a portion of a resource, and may work differently for different types of documents and content types. Also for a specific content type, multiple kind of selector can be defined to cover specific needs.

== Classes Of Selectors ==

*Selector* is a generic class that can be customized/sub-classed for the different kind of content types:
 * *Text Selector*: Identifies a chunk of a text.
   * *Offset Range Selector*: identifies a chunk of text specifying the offset from the beginning of the document and the range - number of characters from the offset.
 * *Image Selector*: Identifies a portion of an image.
 * *Audio Selector*: Identifies a section of an audio file.
 * ...

== Define New Selectors ==

We are not assuming we are able to provide every possible way to select any part of a any kind of document. Therefore, if the selector you have in mind is not yet existing, it is sufficient to define a new one sub-classing one of the existing *Selector* classes.
