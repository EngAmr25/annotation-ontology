A *Selector* identifies a portion of a resource, and may work differently for different types of documents and content types. Also for a specific content type, multiple kind of selector can be defined to cover specific needs.

=== Classes Of Selectors ===

*Selector* is a generic class that can be customized/sub-classed for the different kind of content types:

 * *Text Selector*: identifies a chunk of a text. Some sub-types:
     * *Offset Range Selector*: identifies a chunk of text specifying the offset from the beginning of the document and the range - number of characters from the offset - [OffsetRangeSelector read more about this selector]
     * *Prefix Postfix Selector*: identifies a chunk of text specifying a reasonable amount of characters before it (prefix) and a reasonable amount of characters after it  (postfix) - [PrefixPostfixSelector read more about this selector]

 * *Image Selector*: identifies a portion of an image.
   * *Init End Corner Selector*: identifies a rectangular region of an image through the definition of the top left and bottom right corners - [InitEndCornerSelector read more about this selector]

 * *Audio Selector*: identifies a section of an audio file.

 * *Video Selector*: identifies a section of an video file.

=== Define New Selectors ===

We are not assuming we are able to provide every possible way to select any part of a any kind of document. Therefore, if the selector you have in mind is not yet existing, it is sufficient to define a new one sub-classing one of the existing *Selector* classes.
