= Annotation Sets =

|| *Annotation Set(s)* are container of Annotation items. They are used to organize collection of items and refer to them as a whole.  ||

This can be particularly useful for defining access restriction rules on a set of Annotation items and/or for grouping Annotation items with similar topic. For instance, in figure 1 the declared topic is PRO:00000001 (Protein).
