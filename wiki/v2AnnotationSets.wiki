= Annotation Sets =

|| *Annotation Set(s)* are container of _Annotation_ items. They are used to organize collection of items and refer to them as a whole. ||

This can be particularly useful for defining access restriction rules on a set of _Annotation_ items and/or for grouping _Annotation_ items with similar topic, goal or expectation. 

== Simple Example ==

The _AnnotationSet_ is characterized by an identity and by the collection of all the _Annotation_ items that it contains.
