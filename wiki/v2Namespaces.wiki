=== Annotation Ontology v.2 Architecture and Namespaces ===

Annotation Ontology (AO) is composed by the following modules (files):
 * *core*: is defining the core functionalities of AO including the tools for organizing annotation items in sets and sets in perspectives. 
 * *selectors*: is listing all the currently available [Selectors selectors]. 
 * *types*: is defining all the [AnnotationTypes annotation types] other than the generic  _Annotation_


These can be imported in one shot as follow:

{{{
   <owl:imports rdf:resource="http://purl.org/ao/"/>
}}} 

Here are the correspondent namespaces with the prefixes as they will used in the rest of the documentation:

|| *Prefix* || *Name*|| *Namespace*||
|| ao || *Annotation Core* ||  http://purl.org/ao/core/||
|| aox || *Annotation Extensions* || http://purl.org/ao/aox/ ||

These are integration modules:
 * *Annotea Integration*: is defining the mapping of AO with the Annotea project ontology.
 * *FOAF Integration*: is defining the mapping and the constraints to integrate AO with the FOAF vocabulary.

|| *Prefix* || *Name*|| *Namespace*||
|| aoa || *Annotation Ontology Integration with Annotea* || http://purl.org/ao/annotea/ ||
|| aof || *Annotation Ontology Integration with FOAF* || http://purl.org/ao/foaf/ ||
