=== Annotation Ontology v.2 Architecture and Namespaces ===

While the v.1 of Annotation Ontology (AO) was composed by several modules (files), in v.2 the number of namespaces has been reduced to three, one core module and two integrations module:

|| *Prefix* || *Name*|| *Namespace*||
|| ao || *Annotation Ontology Core*. It defines the core functionalities of AO including the tools for <br/> organizing annotation items in sets and sets in perspectives. It includes all the officially <br/> available Selectors and Annotation Types. ||  http://purl.org/ao/core/||
|| aof || *Annotation Ontology Integration with FOAF* || http://purl.org/ao/foaf/ ||
|| aoa || *Annotation Ontology Integration with Annotea*. This module is optional. || http://purl.org/ao/annotea/ ||

These can be imported in one shot as follow:

{{{
   <owl:imports rdf:resource="http://purl.org/ao/"/>
}}}
