=== Annotation Ontology v.2 Architecture and Namespaces ===

While the v.1 of Annotation Ontology (AO) was composed by several modules (files), in v.2 the number of namespaces has been reduced to three:
 * *ao*: is defining the core functionalities of AO including the tools for organizing annotation items in sets and sets in perspectives. 
 * *selectors*: is listing all the currently available [Selectors selectors]. 
 * *types*: is defining all the [AnnotationTypes annotation types] other than the generic  _Annotation_

|| *Prefix* || *Name*|| *Namespace*||
|| ao || *Annotation Ontology* ||  http://purl.org/ao/core/||
|| aoa || *Annotation Ontology Integration with Annotea* || http://purl.org/ao/annotea/ ||
|| aof || *Annotation Ontology Integration with FOAF* || http://purl.org/ao/foaf/ ||

These can be imported in one shot as follow:

{{{
   <owl:imports rdf:resource="http://purl.org/ao/"/>
}}}
