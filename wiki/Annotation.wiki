==== Annotation Core ====

The annotation core has been strongly inspired by the model proposed by the [http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/ Annotea Project]. In both cases, annotations live outside the annotated resource. In particular, the following entities/properties have been extended/reused:

 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#Annotation Annotation (class)]: A super class describing the common features of annotations.
 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#annotates annotates]: The relation between an annotation resource and the resource to which the annotation applies.
 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#context context]: Context within the resource named in annotates to which the annotation most directly applies.

In Annotea, annotations are typed. It is possible to subclass _Annotation_ into more specific annotation classes with their own properties. In AO we maintain the same powerful mechanism to cover *much more than simple tagging: comments, notes, erratum, definition, Hypothesis, Claims, Research Questions...*
