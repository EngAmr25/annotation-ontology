==== Annotation Core ====

The annotation core has been strongly inspired by the model proposed by the [http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/ Annotea Project]. In both cases, annotations live outside the annotated resource. In particular, the following entities/properties have been extended/reused:

 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#Annotation Annotation (class)]: A super class describing the common features of annotations.
 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#annotates annotates]: The relation between an annotation resource and the resource to which the annotation applies.
 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#context context]: Context within the resource named in annotates to which the annotation most directly applies.
 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#body body]: The content of the annotation. Can include markup such has HTML markup.

In Annotea, annotations are typed. It is possible to subclass _Annotation_ into more specific annotation classes with their own properties. In AO we maintain the same powerful mechanism to cover *much more than simple tagging: comments, notes, erratum, definition, Hypothesis, Claims, Research Questions...*

<b>Figure 1 - Example of document annotation with AO. Using Qualifier(s) is equivalent in tagging a document where, instead of a free text tag, a specific entity in the [http://pir.georgetown.edu/pro/pro.shtml PRO ontology] has been used. </b>

<b>Figure 2 - Example of text annotation with AO. Using Qualifier(s) is equivalent in performing tagging of a part of the document where, instead of a free text tag, a specific entity in the [http://pir.georgetown.edu/pro/pro.shtml PRO ontology] has been used. </b>

<b>Figure 4 - Example of note with AO. As it was happening in Annotea, in AO we subclass the Annotation class into a more specific annotation class. In this case we have a Note on a portion of an image. An _Image Selector_ has been used.</b>
