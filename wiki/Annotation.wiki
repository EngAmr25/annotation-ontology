==== Annotation Core ====

The annotation core has been strongly inspired by the model proposed by the [http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/ Annotea Project]. In particular, the following entities/properties have been extended/reused:

 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#Annotation Annotation (class)]: A super class describing the common features of annotations.
 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#annotates annotates]: The relation between an annotation resource and the resource to which the annotation applies.
 * [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#context context]: Context within the resource named in annotates to which the annotation most directly applies.
