=== Qualifiers and SKOS ===

Qualifier is one of the key annotation types in AO as it allows defining a parallelism between AO and the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) model. A Qualifier is defining a generic connection between the annotated entity and a semantic entity. This is mimicking the relationship skos:relatedMatch. Qualifier SKOS-compatible subclasses that are: ExactQualifier, CloseQualifier, NarrowerQualifier and BroaderQualifier; these correspond respectively to the SKOS properties: skos:exactMatch, skos:closeMatch, skos:broaderMatch and skos:narrowerMatch. See the following table for more details:

|| *Annotation Type* || *SKOS Property* || *Definition* ||
|| Qualifier || skos:relatedMatch || It expresses a relationship between the object of the annotation and a well-defined semantic entity. It allows also a free text body. If only the latter is present this is equivalent to a tag. ||
|| ExactQualifier || skos:exactMatch || Used when the object of the relationship ao:hasTopic is representing exactly the portion of the annotated document. ||
|| CloseQualifier || skos:closeMatch || Used when the object of the relationship ao:hasTopic is representing closely but not exactly the portion of the annotated document. ||
|| BroaderQualifier || skos:broaderMatch || Used when the object of the relationship ao:hasTopic is representing broadly the portion of the annotated document. ||
|| NarrowerQualifier || skos:narrowerMatch || Used when the object of the relationship ao:hasTopic is representing a more specific entity than the portion of the annotated document. ||
