#summary Body as Literals.

= Body as Literals =

The simpler case of _ao:body_ is when it is modeled as a [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal rdfs:Literal]. As such, no URI is defined for it.

*Note*: This solution is certainly very simple to implement, however, as no URI is defined for the body content, it will not be possible to directly refer to it or target it with another annotation.

_Figure 1: a (free text) note attached to a digital document identified by a URI. The nature of the annotation is defined through the type ao:Note._

The RDF of the example in figure 1 would look like the following: 

{{{ 
<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://my.example.org/ann/0004"> 
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&ao;Note"/> 
   <!-- The following can be added for querying with SPARQL
   if your SPARQL engine is still not supporting subclasses 
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&ao;Annotation"/> 
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&ann;Annotation"/> 
   --> 
   <ao:annotatesResource rdf:resource="http://tinyurl.com/3ecvhzu"/>
