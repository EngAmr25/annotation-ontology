= Body as Literals =

The simpler case of _ao:body_ is when it is modeled as a [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal rdfs:Literal] ([http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/#dfn-plain-literal plain] or [http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/#dfn-typed-literal typed]). As such, no URI is defined for it.

Here is a very simple example in n3 format:

{{{ 
 <http://www.example.org/annotation/10022> a ao:Annotation ;
    ao:annotatesResource <http://annotationframework.org> ;
    ao:body "Domeo Annotation Toolkit homepage"@en ;
    pav:createdBy <http://www.paolociccarese.info/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    pav:createdOn "2012-02-12T15:02:14Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
}}}

The interpretation of the above set of triples is simple: the textual body "Domeo Annotation Toolkit homepage" is somehow about the resource identified by the URI http://annotationframework.org.

*Notes*:
 * This solution is very simple to implement, however, as no URI is defined for the body content, it will not be possible to directly refer to it or target it with another annotation.

 * It is not recommended to serialize RDF content as a [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal rdfs:Literal], a more appropriate representation is available for this specific use case.


===  Textual note targeting a document ===

Excerpt from [v2Ex0004NoteOnDocument (ex0004)].

_Figure 1: a (free text) note attached to a digital document identified by a URI. The nature of the annotation is defined through the type ao:Note._

The RDF of the example in figure 1 would look like the following: 

{{{ 
<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://my.example.org/ann/0004"> 
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&ao;Note"/> 
   <!-- The following can be added for querying with SPARQL
   if your SPARQL engine is still not supporting subclasses 
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&ao;Annotation"/> 
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&ann;Annotation"/> 
   --> 
   <ao:annotatesResource rdf:resource="http://tinyurl.com/3ecvhzu"/> 
   <ao:body>This article explains the rationale behind the architectural
     design of the Annotation Ontology </ao:body>
