== Highlight of a portion of a video fragment ==

For annotating temporal media - such as videos and audios - fragments, we suggest to implement the recommendations collected in the [http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/Fragments/WD-media-fragments-spec/ W3C Media Fragment specification] document. This allows the identification of a specific fragment of the target by defining a URI that usually embeds a specific time interval (read more [http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/Fragments/WD-media-fragments-spec/ here]). 

For detecting sections of the video fragment we suggest to use the [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/shapes.html basic shapes] of [http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/ Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)]. This is possible through the [v2SvgSelector SVG Selector].
