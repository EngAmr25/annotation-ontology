#summary A Simple Overview of the Annotation Ontology

== Introduction ==

The idea of Annotation Ontology (AO) is very simple yet powerful, AO allows you to:
 * Annotate: 
   * *RESOURCES* such as HTML, PDF, Word, Excel, XML documents, images, videos, databases, web services, experiments data and metadata... *AND THEIR FRAGMENTS*
 * Specifying (or not) an: 
   * *ANNOTATION TYPE* expressed through one of the already available  types (errata, highlight, qualifiers...) or the ones you will define
 * With (or without) a: 
   * *TOPIC* expressed by free text, structured text, URIs, RDF entities, RDF graphs, terms from domain ontologiesâ€¦
 * With (or without) an: 
   * *EXPECTATION* expressed by free text or better by terms from a controlled vocabulary or an ontology
 * While tracking:
   * *PROVENANCE*: who created what, when, with which software, with what expectations...

=== Some Non-Semantic Basic Examples ===

1) Recording the reading position.
2) Highlighting of a document section.
3) Annotating a document section with a free text note.
