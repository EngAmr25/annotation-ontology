== Note of a video fragment ==

|| _A *note* is defined as a brief record of facts, topics, or thoughts, written down as an aid to memory. When using the term 'Note' we here refer only to free text notes._ ||

For annotating temporal media - such as videos and audios - fragments, we suggest to implement the recommendations collected in the [http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/Fragments/WD-media-fragments-spec/ W3C Media Fragment specification] document. This allows the identification of a specific fragment of the target by defining a URI that usually embeds a specific time interval (read more [http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/Fragments/WD-media-fragments-spec/ here]). 

=== Example ===

[http://annotation-ontology.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/v2/v2Ex0032%20Note%20on%20video%20fragment%20-%20Example%20-%20by%20Paolo%20Ciccarese.png]<br/>
_Figure 1: annotation of a video fragment. You might notice the label 'video URI fragment'. The URI, in the case of the fragment from second 10 to second 20, would look something like this http://www.example.com/video.ogv#t=10,20 or from second 120 to 121.5 something like  http://www.example.com/video.ogv#t=0:02:00,121.5 _


=== Representation with AO ===
