== ao:body ==

|| _*ao:body*_ || The _ao:body_ property identifies the textual or hypertextual body of the annotation. It can be simple text/hypertext or a persistent resource identified by a URI such as an HTML document available online. || 

_*Note*: because of the body is identified by a URI, it can be targeted by other annotations._

== Body as resource (Identified by URI) ==

The body can be modeled as a resolvable entity of its own identified by a URI. Such body can be better detailed with metadata such as properties specifying authors, character encoding and format.

=== Note Body as a Document ===

Because of the body is identified by a URI, it can be targeted by other annotations. 

=== Annotation of Body Document ===

=== Annotation of Body Document Fragment ===

Similarly, it is possible to annotate a fragment of the annotation body through an appropriate text selector.

== Body as text/hypertext (Literal) ==

The simpler case of body is when it is modeled as a text (or hypertext, or XML) into a property. No URI is defined for it.

_*Note*: As no URI is defined for it, it will not be easy - still possible though - to target such body with another annotation._

===  Textual note targeting a document ===
