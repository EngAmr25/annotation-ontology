== ao:body ==

|| _*ao:body*_ || The _ao:body_ property identifies the textual or hypertextual body of the annotation. It can be simple text/hypertext or a persistent resource identified by a URI such as an HTML document available online. || 

== Body as text/hypertext (Literal) ==

The simpler case of body is when it is modeled as a text (or hypertext, or XML) into a property. No URI is defined for it.

_*Note*: As no URI is defined for it, it will not be easy - still possible though - to target such body with another annotation._

===  Textual note targeting a document ===

See [v2Ex0004NoteOnDocument (ex0004)] for the complete example.

_Figure 1: a (free text) note attached to a digital document identified by a URI. The nature of the annotation is defined through the type ao:Note._

The RDF of the example in figure 1 would look like the following: 

{{{ 
<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://my.example.org/ann/0004"> 
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&ao;Note"/> 
   <!-- The following can be added for querying with SPARQL 
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&ao;Annotation"/> 
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&ann;Annotation"/>

===  Hypertextual note targeting an image ===

See [v2Ex0003NoteOnImage (ex0003)] for the complete example.

=== Body as resource (Identified by URI) ===

The body can also be modeled as a resolvable entity of its own identified by a URI. Such body can be better detailed - with properties such as character encoding and format - and, because of the URI, targeted by other annotations (with or without the need of selectors).
