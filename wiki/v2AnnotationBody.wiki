#summary Use of ao:body property.

[v2Main << Back to Main]

== ao:body ==

|| _*ao:body*_ || The _ao:body_ property identifies the textual or hypertextual body of the annotation. It can be simple text/hypertext or a persistent resource identified by a URI such as an HTML document available online. || 

=== Body as text/hypertext (Literal) ===

The simpler case of body is when it is modeled as a text (or hypertext, or XML) into a property. No URI is defined for it.

==  Text Note on document ==

The RDF of the example in picture 2 would look like the following: 

{{{ 
<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://my.example.org/ann/0004"> 
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&ao;Note"/> 
   <!-- The following can be added for querying with SPARQL 
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&ao;Annotation"/> 
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&ann;Annotation"/> 
   --> 
   <ao:annotatesResource rdf:resource="http://tinyurl.com/3ecvhzu"/>

</rdf:Description>

As no URI is defined for it, it will not be easy - still possible though - to target such body with another annotation. 

=== Body as resources (Identified by URI) ===

The body can also be modeled as a resolvable entity of its own identified by a URI. Such body can be therefore addressed by other annotations (with or without the need of selectors).
