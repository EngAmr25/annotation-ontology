[http://sioc-project.org/ SIOC (Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities)] is an initiative that aims to enable the integration of online community information. AO integrates with SIOC as follows.

The SIOC _classes_ of interest are coming from two different namespaces:

|| SIOC core || [http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/ Specs] || Namespace [http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#] ||
|| SIOC types || || Namespace [http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#] ||

and are:

|| [http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#Item sioc:Item] || An Item is something which can be in a Container ||
|| [http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#Container sioc:Container] || An area in which content Items are contained || 
|| [http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#AnnotationSet sioct:AnnotationSet] || Describes a set of annotations, for example, those created by a particular user or related to a particular topic ||
