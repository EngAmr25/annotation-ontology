=== Text Note on an image fragment ===

Attaching a note to an image fragment requires to identify a particular region of the image. The fragment selection can be performed with an appropriate Selector. In the following example we are using the InitEndImageSelector which is simply identifying a rectangular region of the referenced image. More elaborate Selectors can be defined for more specific use cases.
