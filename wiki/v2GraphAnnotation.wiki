= Graph Annotation =

When the annotation content is intended for machines and is described by a set of triples about a resource, it is recommended to collect them in a graph and to refer to them. 

=== Named Graph ===

|| [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_graph Named Graphs] is the idea that having multiple RDF graphs in a single document/repository and naming them with URIs provides useful additional functionality built on top of the RDF Recommendations. ||

With annotation of the type ao:GraphAnnotation it is possible to attach a set of statements to a target, these are the result of the annotation process carried out in specific conditions that can be encoded in the provenance data. This is the case of the following example in [http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/trig/ TriG format]:

{{{
 # Example #1

{
 <http://www.example.org/annotation/10024> a ao:GraphAnnotation ;
    ao:annotatesResource <http://alturl.com/xxbxn> ;
    ao:body :graphExample ;
    pav:createdWith <http://annotaitonframework.org/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    pav:createdBy <http://www.hcklab.org/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    pav:createdOn "2012-02-12T15:02:14Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
}

:graphExample {
    <http://alturl.com/xxbxn> a foaf:Image ;
        foaf:depicts <http://dbpedia.org/page/Eiffel_Tower> .
}
}}}

The example #1 could be depicted as follows:

[http://annotation-ontology.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/v2/v2%20Graph%20Annotation%20-%20AO%20Annotation%20Ontology%20-%20by%20Paolo%20Ciccarese.png]<br/>

Obviously, the annotation process can be enriched with all the necessary provenance data. If the previous annotation was generated by standing [http://alturl.com/25ydw in front of the Eiffel Tower], that can be recorded - and that would possibly be one of the indicator for establishing trust.

 # Example #2: adding location

{
 <http://www.example.org/annotation/10024> a ao:GraphAnnotation ;
    ao:annotatesResource <http://alturl.com/xxbxn> ;
    ao:body :graphExample ;
    pav:createdWith <http://annotaitonframework.org/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    pav:createdBy <http://www.hcklab.org/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    pav:createdAt :location .
    pav:createdOn "2012-02-12T15:02:14Z"^^xsd:dateTime .

 :location a loc:Point ;
    loc:linkToGoogleMaps <http://alturl.com/25ydw> ;
    loc:longitude "2.2938" ;
    loc:latitude "48.85836" ;
    loc:altitude "35m".
}

:graphExample {
    <http://alturl.com/xxbxn> a foaf:Image ;
        foaf:depicts <http://dbpedia.org/page/Eiffel_Tower> .
}
}}}

The example #2 could be depicted as follows:

[http://annotation-ontology.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/v2/v2%20Graph%20Annotation%20with%20geolocation%20-%20AO%20Annotation%20Ontology%20-%20by%20Paolo%20Ciccarese.png]<br/>

=== Graphs as inline content ===
 
Graphs can be used also to incorporate some additional information about topics. For example, an annotation of type ao:Qualifier is expected to point to a dereferenceable URI through the property ao:hasTopic. However, it is possible to include in the annotation some useful information about the topic so that, if the URI is not dereferenceable for any reason, the annotation can still be informative. In [http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/trig/ TriG format]:

{{{
# Example 3: using graph to describe the topic inline

 {
 <http://www.example.org/annotation/10023> a ao:Qualifier, ao:GraphAnnotation ;
    ao:annotatesResource <http://www.hcklab.org/images/people/paolo_ciccarese.jpg> ;
    ao:hasTopic <http://www.hcklab.org/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    ao:body :graphDescription  ;
    pav:createdBy <http://www.hcklab.org/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    pav:createdOn "2012-02-12T15:02:14Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
 }

 :graphDescription {
    <http://www.paolociccarese.info/foaf.rdf#me> a foaf:Person ;
        foaf:name "Paolo Ciccarese" ;
        foaf:homepage "http://www.paolociccarese.info/" .
 }
}}}

Both types _ao:Qualifier_ and [v2GraphAnnotation ao:GraphAnnotation] have been used. The expectation is that the topic URI is dereferenceable to machine readable content and that the body points to a graph.

=== Graphs for relating multiple targets ===

Another possible use of _ao:GraphAnnotation_ is for relating multiple targets. For example it is possible to state that two annotation instances are not consistent.
