= Graph Annotation =

When the annotation content is intended for machines and is described by a set of triples about a resource, it is recommended to collect them in a graph and to refer to them. 

=== Named Graph ===

|| [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_graph Named Graphs] is the idea that having multiple RDF graphs in a single document/repository and naming them with URIs provides useful additional functionality built on top of the RDF Recommendations. ||

With annotation of the type ao:GraphAnnotation it is possible to attach a set of statements to a target, these are the result of the annotation process carried out in specific conditions that can be encoded in the provenance data. This is the case of the following example in [http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/trig/ TriG format]:

 # Example #1

{
 <http://www.example.org/annotation/10024> a ao:GraphAnnotation ;
    ao:annotatesResource <http://alturl.com/xxbxn> ;
    ao:body :graphExample ;
    pav:createdBy <http://www.hcklab.org/foaf.rdf#me> ;
    pav:createdOn "2012-02-12T15:02:14Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
}

:graphExample {
    <http://alturl.com/xxbxn> a foaf:Image ;
        foaf:depicts <http://dbpedia.org/page/Eiffel_Tower> .
}
}}}

The example #1 could be depicted as follows:
