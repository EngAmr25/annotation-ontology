=== Provenance, Authoring and Versioning ===

AO makes use of the PAV (Provenance, Authoring and Versioning) ontology. The PAV ontology has been created to cover use cases related to the SWAN project. AO is making use of PAV 2.0, which is covering all the curational aspects that are crucial for AO and for publishing content for online scientific communities. 

It is also possible to use [DC Dublin Core or Dublin Core Terms] for covering provenance, we usually suggest to use both PAV and DC as PAV is covering all the curational aspects that are crucial for AO. In some specific cases it is also useful to use FOAF (Friend of A Friend) properties. 

The evolution of the annotation graph is monotonic.
