== Free text tags, notes and comments ==

In the implementation of the following examples you will notice that the nature of the free text expressed in the bubble is determined in Annotation Ontology by the [v2AnnotationTypes Annotation Type]. This is the simplest way to create annotations in AO.
However, with AO it is also possible to adopt an alternative approach that can make better use of already existing ontological frameworks without overloading the annotation types.

=== Tags ===
_*Tagging* means 'attaching a label'. When using the word 'Tag' we here refer only to free text labels._

=== Notes ===

_A *note* is defined as a brief record of facts, topics, or thoughts, written down as an aid to memory. When using the term 'Note' we here refer only to free text notes._
