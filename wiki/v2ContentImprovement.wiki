== Support for Content Improvement ==

Don't be mistaken, Annotation Ontology has not been designed only to deal with already published resources but to support the modern publication process where the annotation of today can become part of the content of tomorrow. 

This is a very common happening in online (scientific) communities where multiple users can give their contribution to make a piece of content more valuable. A popular mechanism for providing feedback is given by comments. However, comments can refer to the entire piece of content or to a fragment of it. With annotations users are able to address precisely a content fragment allowing machines to better understand the ongoing process. Eventually, such annotations can be revised and integrated into the original piece of content. And every step of the process will be documented with detailed provenance.
